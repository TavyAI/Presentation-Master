# Presentation Master
This is the Windows source code for the upcoming Android app.
We upload this to show that this app is not harmful, as some antivirus programs might indicate.

## What it does
The app builds a server on your PC which is listening to requests from your mobile device when the connection is established.
When a request is made, keyboard presses are simulated to control your presentation in the same way you would do it manually. In parallel, a window with a QR code to connect is opened. When you close it, the app will keep running in background.



## What it does not
Although the app stays open in background, it will never do anything without your permission on one of the devices. Also, the only data that is read is your IP address for connecting purposes.



## Contribute
You can contribute if you want to improve the app.
You should be aware that we will use the code and monetize it in the future.

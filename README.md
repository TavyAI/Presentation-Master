# Presentation Master
This is the Windows source code for the PC-part of the mobile Presentation Master app.
We upload this to show that this app is not harmful, as some antivirus programs might indicate.



## What it does
The app builds a server on your PC which is listening to requests from your mobile device when the connection is established.
When a request is made, keyboard presses are simulated to control your presentation in the same way you would do it manually. When you close the Windows window, the app will keep running in background until you restart the PC.



## What it does not
Although the app stays open in background, it will never do anything without your permission on one of the devices. Also, it reads no more sensitive data as any other app.



## Contribute
You can contribute if you want to improve the app.
You should be aware that we will use the code and monetize it in the future.
